# crossplane-resources

The `crossplane-resources` frontend plugin for Backstage provides visibility into the Crossplane claim, composite resource, and managed resources associated with a component. This relies heavily on system-generated annotations from the Kubernetes Ingestor but technically does not require it if you add all the needed annotations manually. The plugin exposes general data, provides a YAML viewer for each resource including the ability to copy to clipboard the content or download the YAML file. It also supports viewing the events related to a specific resource. It also includes a graph view of the resources related to a claim.
