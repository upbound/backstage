# crossplane-permissions

The `crossplane-permissions` backend plugin for Backstage provides integration with Crossplane, enabling permission management and access control for Crossplane resources. This plugin leverages Backstage's permission framework to enforce policies and manage access to Crossplane resources.

Once installed and configured, the crossplane-permissions plugin will provide endpoints for managing permissions and access control for Crossplane resources. You can access these endpoints via the configured routes in your Backstage backend.
